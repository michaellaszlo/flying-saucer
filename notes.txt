- calculated segment lengths


2014.10.26

http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user38_0hwRPWoGSG_7.py
- calculated heights
- drew flat sections at correct heights
- rendered hills as straight lines connecting flats

http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user38_0hwRPWoGSG_11.py
- started to generate hill peaks


2014.10.28

http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user38_0hwRPWoGSG_16.py
- finished generating hill peaks

http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user38_0hwRPWoGSG_17.py
- made a saucer image based on icons8 files
- started the Saucer class and rendered the image to the canvas

http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user38_0hwRPWoGSG_18.py
- added key handling, saucer rotation, return to vertical
- rotation and return to vertical occur at constant speed

- added gravity, friction, saucer boost
- modified angular drift: slowed down; disabled under boost


2014.11.06

http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user38_0hwRPWoGSG_23.py
- separated boost direction from saucer orientation, which is now constant
- made halo graphics to show the boost direction
- wrote a Sprite class to render graphics outside the Saucer class

- added Frame and Viewport classes
- delegated drawing to Saucer and Planet
- worked out conversion from world coordinates to viewport coordinates
- rendered the frame with a zoom factor of 3 (with respect to planet width)
- made the camera track the saucer, keeping it in the viewport center

- tried to wrap around the ends of the world and ran into several bugs
- saw that I was lacking a complete mathematical model for the problem
