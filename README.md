# Flying saucer

You are the pilot of a flying saucer. Humans have invaded your
planet. Your ethics forbid you to use death rays, so you'll have to
proceed by stealth. Fly over the human colony at night, abduct the
invaders one by one, and rescue their livestock.


## What works so far

* You can move the spaceship with the W-A-D keys.

* A finite landscape is randomly generated.

* The game is written in Python and hosted [on
CodeSkulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user42_Y4NDBVzLgY_0.py)
(click the Play button at upper left).

## To be done next

* Wraparound landscape.

* Collision detection.

* Livestock to rescue from the humans.

* Humans attacking the flying saucer.
